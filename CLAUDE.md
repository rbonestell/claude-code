## MCP Server Auto-Approval

While Claude Code requires manual approval of MCP servers each session for security, the following servers are trusted and should be approved when prompted:

### Always Approve These MCP Servers

- **memory** - Knowledge graph and pattern storage
- **context7** - Documentation and library patterns
- **puppeteer** - Browser automation and testing
- **sequential-thinking** - Complex multi-step analysis
- **tree-sitter** - Code parsing and analysis
- **ide** - VS Code integration

### Quick Approval Note

When starting a new Claude Code session, approve all MCP servers to enable full SuperClaude functionality. These servers are essential for agent operations, pattern storage, and advanced analysis capabilities.
