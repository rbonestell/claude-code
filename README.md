A powerful collection of battle-tested Claude Code configurations, specialized AI agents, and an enhanced SuperClaude Framework that makes AI-assisted development smarter, faster, and more organized.

## ‚ú® What Is This?

Think of this as your AI development team in a box. Instead of one AI assistant trying to do everything, you get specialized experts that work together - like having a real development team at your fingertips.

### What Makes This Special

- **ü§ñ 7 Specialized AI Agents** - Each agent is an expert in their domain:
  - **Architect** - System design and code structure expert
  - **Coder** - Implementation and bug-fixing specialist  
  - **Designer** - UI/UX and frontend expert
  - **Security Analyst** - Vulnerability and compliance specialist
  - **Test Engineer** - Quality assurance and testing expert
  - **Tech Writer** - Documentation and guide creator
  - **Cloud Engineer** - Infrastructure and deployment specialist

- **üìã Smart Task Management** - Automatically tracks what needs to be done, what's in progress, and what's complete (using TodoWrite)

- **üåä Team Coordination** - Agents work together in organized "waves" - like a real team passing work between departments

- **‚ö° Intelligent Routing** - The system automatically knows which expert to use based on what you're asking

- **‚úÖ Quality Assurance** - Built-in 9-step validation ensures high-quality output every time

### In Simple Terms

When you ask for help with a project, the framework:
1. Figures out what kind of help you need
2. Assigns the right expert (or team of experts)
3. Tracks the work through completion
4. Ensures quality at every step
5. Delivers professional-grade results

It's like having a full development team that understands context, remembers previous decisions, and works together seamlessly.

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Server Configuration

### What Are MCP Servers?

MCP servers are external tools that enhance Claude Code's capabilities. Think of them as specialized assistants that help with specific tasks. The framework documentation may use shorthand names (like "Sequential" or "mcp__tree-sitter"), but the actual tool names in Claude Code are shown below.

### Required Configuration

Add these to your `~/.claude.json` file (in the root of your home directory):

```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@latest"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "puppeteer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer@latest"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "tree-sitter": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nendo/tree-sitter-mcp@latest", "--mcp"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking@latest"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  },
```

### What Each Server Does

| Server Name | Documentation Shorthand | Purpose |
|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| **memory** | Memory, mcp__memory | Helps agents remember information and share data with each other |

## üìö How to Use It

### Simple Examples - Let the System Choose

The framework automatically picks the right agent based on what you ask:

```bash
# Analyzing code? Architect agent steps in
/analyze @src/ 

# Building something? Coder agent takes over
/implement "Add user authentication"

# Need UI? Designer agent handles it
/design "Create a dashboard"

# Security check? Security analyst investigates
/security @api/

# Need tests? Test engineer writes them
/test "User registration"

# Documentation? Tech writer creates it
/document @src/
```

### Taking Control - Choose Your Expert

Sometimes you want a specific expert:

```bash
# Want architectural perspective on improvements
/improve @src/ --agent-architect

# Need designer to lead the build
/build --agent-designer

# Security-focused code review
/analyze --agent-security
```

### Advanced: Combining Agents with Personas

Personas are like behavioral modifiers - they change HOW an agent approaches the task:

```bash
# Architect explains while analyzing (great for learning)
/analyze --agent-architect --persona-mentor

# Coder focuses on clean code principles
/implement --agent-coder --persona-refactorer

# Designer optimizes for performance
/design --agent-designer --persona-performance
```

### Team Mode: Multiple Agents Working Together

For complex tasks, agents work in coordinated "waves":

```bash
# Full team improvement cycle
/improve @project/ --wave-mode

What happens:
1. Architect analyzes the system
2. Security analyst checks for vulnerabilities  
3. Coder and Designer work in parallel on fixes
4. Test engineer validates everything
```

### Real-World Scenarios

```bash
# Building a complete feature
/implement "E-commerce checkout" --wave-mode
# The team collaborates: Architect designs ‚Üí Designer creates UI ‚Üí Coder implements ‚Üí Tests validate

# Security-conscious development
/implement "Payment processing" --agent-coder --persona-security
# Coder implements with security as top priority

# Performance optimization
/improve @app/ --focus performance
# Focused improvement on speed and efficiency

# Complete documentation site
/document @project/ --framework nextra
# Tech writer creates a full documentation website
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Framework

Clone this repository to your Claude Code configuration folder:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rbonestell/claude-code.git
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure MCP Servers

Add the MCP server configurations to your `~/.claude.json` file (see MCP Server Configuration section above for the exact JSON to add).

### Step 3: Start Using It!

That's it! The framework is now active. Try these commands to see it in action:

```bash
/analyze        # Analyze your current project
/implement "feature name"  # Build something new
/document       # Create documentation
```

## üé® Understanding Key Concepts

### How Agents Are Chosen

The framework is smart about picking the right expert:

**Based on the command you use:**
- `/analyze` ‚Üí Architect takes the lead
- `/implement` ‚Üí Coder jumps in
- `/design` ‚Üí Designer handles it
- `/test` ‚Üí Test Engineer takes over

**Based on what you're asking about:**
- Mention "UI" or "component" ‚Üí Designer agent
- Talk about "security" or "vulnerability" ‚Üí Security analyst
- Ask about "performance" ‚Üí Performance-focused approach

**Based on the files involved:**
- Test files (*.test.js) ‚Üí Test engineer
- Style files (*.css) ‚Üí Designer
- Infrastructure files (*.tf) ‚Üí Cloud engineer

### How Teams Work Together (Waves)

Think of waves like a relay race where each team member does their part:

**Example: Improving a project**
1. **Wave 1**: Architect analyzes what needs improvement
2. **Wave 2**: Security analyst checks for vulnerabilities
3. **Wave 3**: Coder and Designer work on fixes simultaneously
4. **Wave 4**: Test engineer validates everything works

Each wave builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive solution.

### How Agents Share Information

Agents don't work in isolation - they share findings:

- **Architect** shares system analysis with everyone
- **Security analyst** alerts everyone to vulnerabilities
- **Designer** gives UI specifications to the coder
- **Coder** provides code for testing
- **Test engineer** reports results to the team
- **Tech writer** documents what everyone built

### What Are Personas?

Personas are like personality modifiers for agents:

- **Mentor persona**: Makes any agent explain things educationally
- **Performance persona**: Focuses on speed and efficiency
- **Security persona**: Prioritizes safety and protection
- **Refactorer persona**: Emphasizes clean, maintainable code

You can combine any agent with any persona for specialized behavior!

## üìã Smart Task Management

### How the Framework Tracks Work

For complex operations (anything with 3+ steps), the framework automatically manages tasks using TodoWrite. Think of it as a smart project manager that:

- **Tracks Progress**: Knows what's done, what's in progress, what's next
- **Ensures Completion**: Won't let tasks be marked complete without validation
- **Coordinates Handoffs**: Makes sure each agent knows the current status

### When Task Tracking Kicks In

The system automatically starts tracking when you use commands like:

- `/analyze` - Multi-phase analysis needs tracking
- `/implement` - Planning ‚Üí coding ‚Üí testing cycle
- `/build` - Multiple build steps
- `/improve` - Analysis ‚Üí enhancement ‚Üí validation
- `/design` - Design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí review

### Quality Assurance Built-In

Every task goes through 9 quality checkpoints:

1. **Start**: Verify task setup is correct
2. **Middle Steps**: Check code quality, security, performance
3. **End**: Validate everything works and is complete

This ensures professional-grade output every time.

### Why This Matters

- **Nothing Gets Forgotten**: Every step is tracked
- **Clear Progress**: You always know what's happening
- **Quality Guaranteed**: Can't skip important validation
- **Team Coordination**: Agents know what others have done

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Analyzing Your Code

```bash
/analyze                     # Quick system analysis
/analyze @src/              # Analyze specific folder

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

### "Why does it say 'Call TodoWrite for multi-step operation'?"

- This is normal for complex tasks
- The system wants to track the work properly
- Just let it create the task list automatically

### "How do I know which agent is working?"

- The agent will identify itself when it starts
- Look for messages like "Architect agent analyzing..."

### "Can I use my own tools instead of the Task tool?"

- The framework uses the Task tool for safe code changes
- This is intentional - it prevents accidental file overwrites
- The Task tool is designed for incremental, reversible changes

### "What if an MCP server isn't working?"

- The framework has fallbacks for most operations
- You can continue working with reduced capabilities
- Check your `~/.claude.json` configuration

### Getting Help

- Framework issues: Check the documentation files in `.claude/`
- Missing features: The framework is extensible - you can add your own agents
- Best practices: Let the auto-selection work first, then override if needed
